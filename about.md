I'm Gary Grumbley, and this is my little corner of the internet. This is where I  post whatever I am working on, from projects to articles. I live and work in beautiful San Diego, California. Where I enjoy making web apps and hacking on open source hardware projects. I am also a licensed attorney with a specialization in intellectual property.
