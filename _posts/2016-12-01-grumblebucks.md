This is a demo app I built to demonstrate front-end JavaScript techniques. This a simple web form for a fictitious coffee company called Grumblebucks. The user inputs their order which then shows up in a drink queue for the barista. This app is primarily plain JavaScript using object oriented techniques for organizing my code. I used the Yeti Bootswatch theme for simple styling.
